1. the intuition behind fused operators
The intuition behind fused operators is to put multiple operator's computations 
into one operator and therefore only need to compute once. This is benefitial 
because with less computation we can access memeory less frequent and therefore 
decrease the memeory IO.


2. why it works for improving efficiency
Since fused operators can decrease memeory IO, this can increase the Arithmetic 
Itensity and therefore improve the efficiency. AI = FLOPS / # Memory access, we 
decrease the # Memory access by merging operations and therefore increase the 
AI.



3. potential future improvements to these operators
Use tiling to further decrease the Memory IO to increase AI.
